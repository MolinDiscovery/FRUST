## Overview

**FRUST** (Frustrated Activation) is a research tool that automates much of the dirty work involved in exploring FLP-type activation mechanisms and related reactions:

- Generate and transform molecules from simple input (e.g. SMILES, TS templates)
- Enumerate conformers and pre-optimize them
- Build transition-state guesses for specific activation patterns
- Run xTB/DFT workflows (often via ORCA) in a structured, restartable way
- Collect results into tidy tables (Parquet/CSV) ready for downstream analysis

The package is designed around *pipelines* and *steps* that can be chained, composed, and re-used, making it easier to go from "a list of ligands" to "TS energies, geometries, and diagnostics" without dozens of ad-hoc scripts.

Although originally developed for **FLP-mediated C–H activation and borylation systems**, FRUST is intended to be general enough for other small-molecule TS studies.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python** 3.10+
- **Recommended**: a Conda or mamba environment
- **RDKit** (for conformer generation and molecular manipulation)
- Optional but strongly recommended:
    - [xTB] installed and available on `PATH`
    - [ORCA] installed and accessible (especially on HPC)

The exact installation of xTB/ORCA is environment- and cluster-specific and is not handled by this package.

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd FRUST
pip install -e .
```

This installs FRUST in **editable** ("development") mode so code changes are picked up without reinstalling.

### Dependencies

Most core Python dependencies are installed automatically, including (but not limited to):

- `rdkit` – molecular manipulation and conformer generation
- `numpy` – numerical computations
- `pandas` – data handling and analysis
- `matplotlib` – basic plotting / visualization
- `tqdm` – progress bars and basic CLI feedback

You may also have additional, more specialized dependencies depending on which parts of the package you use (e.g. optional ML/backend tooling).

---

## Quick Start

Right now FRUST is primarily driven through **Python** and **Jupyter notebooks**. The CLI is intentionally minimal while the APIs stabilize.

### Minimal Python Example

Example: generate TS jobs for a set of ligands and run a single TS pipeline entry using xTB/DFT.

```python
import pandas as pd

from frust.pipes import create_ts_per_rpos, run_ts_per_rpos

# Example input data: SMILES + rpos information
df = pd.read_csv("datasets/ir_borylation.csv")
smiles_list = list(dict.fromkeys(df["smiles"]))

# A TS template structure (e.g. from a reference calculation)
TS_TEMPLATE_XYZ = "structures/ts1_template.xyz"

# 1) Build per-ligand job descriptions
job_inputs = create_ts_per_rpos(smiles_list, TS_TEMPLATE_XYZ)

# Pick one job (e.g. index 0) and run a small test
job = job_inputs[0]
tag = list(job.keys())[0]

results_df = run_ts_per_rpos(
    job,
    n_confs=1,          # small number of conformers for testing
    n_cores=10,         # cores for xTB/ORCA
    mem_gb=30,          # memory budget in GB
    debug=False,
    DFT=True,           # enable DFT refinement
    out_dir="test_run",
    output_parquet=f"test_run/{tag}.parquet",
    save_output_dir=True,
    work_dir="local_test",
)

print(results_df.head())
```

This pattern is typical for FRUST:

1. Build a **list of jobs** from simple input (SMILES + TS template).
2. Run a **pipeline function** that handles individual jobs (xTB → DFT, etc.).
3. Get a nice **DataFrame / Parquet file** you can analyze further.

## Project Structure (High-Level)

The exact layout may evolve, but the repo is roughly organized as:

- `frust/`  

  Core Python package with:
    - Pipeline and step definitions (`frust.pipes`)
    - Embedding / transformation utilities (`embedder.py`, `transformers.py`)
    - Execution helpers (`stepper.py`, monitoring, simple I/O utilities)
- `scripts/`  

  Small command-line helpers and submission scripts, e.g.:
    - `submit.py`, `submit2.py`, `submit3.py` – Slurm/HPC helpers
    - Utility scripts to merge `.parquet` outputs, test jobs, etc.
- `playground/`  

  Local scratch space for results, dev experiments, and temporary runs.  

  (Only selected `.py` / `.ipynb` files are tracked; most large output trees are intentionally **not** under version control.)
- `dev/`  

  Development notebooks and prototypes (see next section).
- `datasets/`  

  Example input data and reference datasets, e.g.:
    - `ir_borylation.csv` – FLP borylation dataset with SMILES and active sites

No formal `tests/` directory yet – validation currently happens through targeted development / playground notebooks and small smoke scripts. A pytest suite will be added once core APIs stabilize.

Because this is active research code, some directories are intentionally lightly structured and used as a "lab bench" (especially `playground/` and `dev/`).

---

## Development Notebooks

Several Jupyter notebooks live under `dev/` and act as both documentation and integration tests for the core pipeline:

- `dev0_pipe_init.ipynb` – pipeline initialization / basic wiring
- `dev1_generic_lig_identi.ipynb` – ligand identification / mapping logic
- `dev2_pipe_fix_dirs.ipynb` – directory and output layout experiments
- `dev3_pipe_test_run.ipynb` – first end-to-end test runs
- `dev4_pipe_test_constrains.ipynb` – constrained optimizations and edge cases

These notebooks are not part of the public API, but they are useful references for how the system is intended to be used.

---

## Pipeline Workflow

A typical FRUST pipeline for an FLP activation study looks like:

1. **Molecular transformation** – Take input structures (SMILES + TS template / reference TS), apply bond-breaking / bond-forming rules to build TS-like guess structures, and map ligand positions (`rpos`) into the TS template.
2. **Conformer generation** – Enumerate conformers using RDKit and apply filters and pre-selection (energy windows, RMSD pruning, etc.).
3. **Pre-optimization** – Use UFF or xTB (e.g. GFN-FF / GFN2-xTB) to get reasonable geometries and optionally use constraints to preserve key activation motifs.
4. **Quantum chemical refinement** – ORCA DFT optimizations and/or single-point calculations, frequency calculations when needed (e.g. to confirm TS nature), and optional external-method hooks (e.g. UMA or other ML potentials).
5. **Analysis & output** – Collect energies, geometries, and metadata into pandas DataFrames, write `.parquet` and/or `.csv` files, and provide hooks for plotting, filtering, and ranking candidates.

Different reactions (e.g. "TS1", "TS3", "TS4" stages of a catalytic cycle) may correspond to different pipeline variants in `frust.pipes`.

---

## Environment Variables & External Tools

There is currently no global configuration object. Most resource controls (e.g. `n_cores`, `mem_gb`, `debug`) are passed directly as keyword arguments to pipeline functions such as `run_ts_per_rpos` and `run_mols`.

Some advanced workflows (UMA-integrated optimizations) require the environment variable `UMA_TOOLS` to be set to the path of ORCA's external tools directory. Add this to your `~/.env` or shell profile, e.g.:

```bash
export UMA_TOOLS="/path/to/orca/external-tools"
```

If `UMA_TOOLS` is missing, UMA-related functions will raise a runtime error.

> A lightweight configuration layer may return later; for now explicit arguments keep runs transparent while the API evolves.

## Stepper Showcase (xTB / ORCA Chaining)

`Stepper` composes calculation stages by returning a new DataFrame every time

you call `xtb(...)` or `orca(...)`. Each stage adds columns with a predictable

prefix; changing the workflow is just reordering calls, tweaking `options`,

or dropping columns.

Minimal pattern (see `examples/stepper_showcase.py` for full version):

```python
from rdkit import Chem
from frust.embedder import embed_mols
from frust.stepper import Stepper

smis = ["CCO", "c1ccccc1"]
embedded = embed_mols({"mol0": Chem.MolFromSmiles(smis[0])}, n_confs=3)
step = Stepper(smis, debug=True, save_output_dir=False)
df = step.build_initial_df(embedded)

# Chain xTB levels
df = step.xtb(df, options={"gfnff": None, "opt": None})      # pre-opt
df = step.xtb(df, options={"gfn": 2})                         # SP
df = step.xtb(df, options={"gfn": 2, "opt": None}, lowest=1) # keep lowest per ligand

# Add ORCA stages (mock in debug mode)
df = step.orca(df, options={"HF": None, "STO-3G": None, "SP": None})
df = step.orca(df, name="dft", options={"wB97X-D3": None, "6-31G**": None, "Opt": None})

# Remove a stage (drop columns) & refine
dft_cols = [c for c in df.columns if c.startswith("dft-")]
df = df.drop(columns=dft_cols)
df = step.orca(df, name="sp_refine", options={"wB97X-D3": None, "6-31G**": None, "SP": None})
```

Highlights:

- Functional chaining; original rows preserved unless filtered by `lowest=`.
- Adjust cores per xTB call with `n_cores` (arg on `xtb` only).
- Column prefixes (`xtb-gfn2-opt`, `orca-wB97X-D3-6-31G**-Opt`, etc.) make it trivial to select or remove stages.
- UMA external optimizations: provide `uma="task@profile"` in `orca(...)` once `UMA_TOOLS` is set.

This modular approach avoids large monolithic driver scripts and encourages rapid iteration.

## Research Context

FRUST is being developed as part of an ongoing PhD project on **computational catalyst discovery**, with a focus on:

- Frustrated Lewis pair (FLP) activation mechanisms
- Automated transition-state generation for small-molecule reactions
- High-throughput ligand screening for catalytic systems
- Integration with active-learning and genetic algorithm workflows

The code is research-grade rather than polished "product" software: clarity, reproducibility, and flexibility are prioritized over backward compatibility.

---

## Contributing

While this is primarily a research codebase, contributions and feedback are very welcome, especially if you:

- Want to use FRUST in your own FLP / TS studies
- Have ideas for making the pipelines more general or robust
- Spot bugs or edge cases in RDKit/xTB/ORCA handling

Suggested contribution flow:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
2. Install in development mode: `pip install -e .`
3. Run a small smoke example (e.g. the Quick Start snippet) to ensure your environment works.
4. If adding new logic, mirror usage in a dev or playground notebook; when a formal test suite is introduced, include pytest coverage.
5. Open a pull request with a clear description of the change and its motivation.
